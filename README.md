# Wagner-Fischer Algorithm Based on Levenshtein Algorithm

Algorithm devoloped to check and correct spell mistakes, implemented in a search bar

## Purpose

The purpose of this project is to calculate the distance between two strings using the Wagner-Fischer model, which is based on the Levenshtein algorithm.

## Contents

1. Documentation PDF detailing the algorithm's working and time complexity.
2. The algorithm implemented in three separate files:
    - Python (`.py`)
    - C++ (`.cpp`)
    - JavaScript (`.js`)
3. A hidden folder containing the LaTeX file (this folder should be ignored).

## Note

1. The algorithm does not currently include functionality for dictionary words in a separate file. This feature is yet to be implemented.
2. There is no proper way to manage spaces for better recommendation, as of now, its considered as any other charecter

## Installation

Explain how to install the project if necessary. If it's a collection of files, you might skip this section.
